# CS680 3D modeling and model transformation

Student Name: `Zhenghang Yin`
BUID: `U82871437`

In this PA, I using 3D modeling and model transformation, built a model and make it move by performing transformations on its joints, a RX-78-2 gundam's simplified version.

In this program, five preset pose was included, by pressing key 1 - 5. And the support of eye moving was also added.
